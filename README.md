# flatcrawl-isochrones

This repository is part of my **flatcrawl project**. The isochrones service can calculate isochrone lines that show how far one can travel from a starting point into all different directions around. It is for instance used in the web-service to show the user, which areas are considered for a given search configuration.

## The flatcrawl project

The purpose of the project is to **collect flats from different rental sites** and **expose them in a consistent shape**. Eventually it lets users define **custom searches** and provides them with **instant updates on new matching flats**.

**Clarification**: flats are *not* stored on the server. The purpose is not to create a competing portal, but to extend usability and help users find the right flat quickly by receiving updates from several sites without the hassle to setup and maintain different searches.
